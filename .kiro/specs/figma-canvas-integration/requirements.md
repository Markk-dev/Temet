# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating the existing Figma clone functionality into the main Temet project. The integration will allow users to access the canvas/design functionality directly from the Temet sidebar, creating a unified experience where the Figma clone becomes a native part of the Temet platform rather than a separate application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Temet user, I want to access the canvas functionality through the existing Canvas button in the sidebar, so that I can create and edit designs without leaving the main application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the Canvas button in the Temet sidebar THEN the system SHALL navigate to the integrated Figma canvas interface
2. WHEN the canvas interface loads THEN the system SHALL display all the Figma clone functionality within the Temet application layout
3. WHEN navigating to the canvas THEN the system SHALL maintain the Temet sidebar and overall application structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to merge the Figma clone components and dependencies into the main Temet project, so that there is a single codebase to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the Figma clone THEN the system SHALL move all necessary components from the figma_clone folder to the appropriate locations in the src directory
2. WHEN merging dependencies THEN the system SHALL consolidate package.json files to include all required Figma clone dependencies
3. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove the separate figma_clone folder structure
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL successfully compile with all integrated components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the canvas functionality to work seamlessly within Temet, so that I have access to all design tools and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the canvas THEN the system SHALL provide all original Figma clone features including drawing tools, shape creation, and text editing
2. WHEN working on designs THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time collaboration features if they exist
3. WHEN saving or loading designs THEN the system SHALL integrate with Temet's data management approach
4. WHEN switching between Temet features and canvas THEN the system SHALL preserve user work and state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper routing and navigation, so that the canvas integration feels native to the Temet application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up routing THEN the system SHALL create appropriate Next.js routes for the canvas functionality
2. WHEN navigating to canvas THEN the system SHALL use Temet's existing routing patterns and navigation structure
3. WHEN on the canvas page THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent URL structure with the rest of Temet
4. WHEN users bookmark or share canvas URLs THEN the system SHALL provide proper deep linking support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent styling and theming, so that the canvas feels like an integrated part of Temet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the canvas interface THEN the system SHALL use Temet's existing design system and styling approach
2. WHEN applying themes THEN the system SHALL ensure canvas components respect Temet's theme configuration
3. WHEN viewing the canvas THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency with other Temet features
4. IF there are styling conflicts THEN the system SHALL prioritize Temet's design patterns over the original Figma clone styles
