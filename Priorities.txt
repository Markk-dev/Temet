So i want to work on my quiries to improve performance, i might have made queries to fetch
seperately thus a build-up of fetch araises and might overload the system if persist. i want to batch
if needed just to make compilation and fetching faster

look at this when i open My project route: http://localhost:3000/workspaces/68adcf2400021b89f032/projects/68add081000c239a88bd (this is a dynamic route)
